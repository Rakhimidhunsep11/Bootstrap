      Kuchipudi  is one of the eight major Indian classical dances. It originates from a 
village named Kuchipudi in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

Kuchipudi is a dance-drama performance, with its roots in the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text 
of Natya Shastra. It developed as a religious art linked to traveling bards,
 temples and spiritual beliefs, like all major classical dances of India. Evidence of
 Kuchipudi's existence in an older version are found in copper inscriptions of the 10th 
century, and by the 15th century in texts such as the Machupalli Kaifat.
 Kuchipudi tradition holds that Tirtha Narayana Yati a sanyassin of Advaita Vedanta
 persuasion, and his disciple, an orphan named Siddhendra Yogi, founded and 
systematized the modern version of Kuchipudi in the 17th century.
 Kuchipudi largely developed as a Krishna-oriented 
Vaishnavism tradition, and it is known by the name of Bhagavata Mela in Thanjavur.
