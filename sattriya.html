      The Sattriya dance form was introduced in the 15th century A.D by the great Vaishnava saint and reformer of Assam, 
      Mahapurusha Sankaradeva as a powerful medium for the propagation of the Vaishnava faith.
      
      This Indian dance form evolved and expanded as a distinct style of dance later on.
      
      This neo-Vaishnava treasure of Assamese dance and drama has been, for centuries, nurtured and preserved with great 
      commitment by the Sattras i.e. Vaishnava maths or monasteries.Because of its religious character and association with the Sattras, this dance style was aptly named Sattriya.
      Sankaradeva introduced this dance form by incorporating different elements from various treatises, local folk dance with 
      his own rare outlook.
      There were two dance forms prevalent in Assam before the neo- Vaishnava movement such as Ojapali and Devadasi with
       many classical elements.
