      Kathak is one of the eight major forms of Indian classical 
      dance. It is the classical dance form from Uttar Pradesh. The origin of Kathak is 
      traditionaly attributed to the traveling bards in ancient northern India known 
      as Kathakars or storytellers. The term Kathak is derived from the Vedic Sanskrit word 
      Katha which means "story", and Kathakar which means "the one who tells a story", or "to 
      do with stories". Wandering Kathakars communicated stories from the great epics and 
      ancient mythology through dance, songs and music. Kathak dancers tell various stories
       through their hand movements and extensive footwork, their body movements and flexibility
       but most importantly through their facial expressions. Kathak evolved during the Bhakti 
      movement, particularly by incorporating the childhood and stories of the Hindu god Krishna,
       as well as independently in the courts of north Indian kingdoms. During the period of
       Mughal rule, the emperors were parons of Kathak dance and actively promoted it in their
       royal courts. Kathak performance include Urdu Ghazals and commonly used instruments
       brought during the Mughal period.
