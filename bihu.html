      The Bihu dance is an indigenous folk dance from the Indian state of Assam related to the 
      Bihu festival and an important part of Assamese culture. Performed in a group, the Bihu 
      dancers are usually young men and women, and the dancing style is characterized by brisk
       steps, and rapid hand movements. The traditional costume of dancers is colorful and centered round the red color theme, signifying joy and vigour.
      The origins of the dance form is unknown, however the folk dance tradition has always 
      been very significant in the culture of Assam's diverse ethnic groups, such as Kaivarttas,
       Deoris, Sonowal Kacharis, Chutias, Boros, Misings, Rabhas, Moran and Borahis, among others
      .[1] According to scholars, the Bihu dance has its origin in ancient fertility cults that
       was associated with increasing the fertility of the demographic as well as the land.
       Traditionally, local farming communities performed the dance outdoors,
       in fields, groves, forests or on the banks of rivers, especially under the fig tree
