     Garba  is a form of Gujarati dance which originates from the state of 
Gujarat in India. The name is derived from the Sanskrit term Garbha .[1] Many traditional 
garbas are performed around a centrally lit lamp or a picture or statue of the Goddess 
Shakti. Traditionally, it is performed during the nine-day Indian festival Navarātrī , where નવ means 9, and રાત્રી means 
nights). Either the lamp(the Garba Deep) or an image of the Goddess, Durga (also called Amba) is placed in 
middle of concentric rings as an object of veneration.
