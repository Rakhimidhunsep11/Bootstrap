      Kathakali ( IAST: Kathakaḷi Malayalam: കതകളി) is a major form of classical Indian dance.
      It is a "story play" genre of art, but one distinguished by the elaborately colourful
      make-up and costumes of the traditional male actor-dancers.It is native to the 
     Malayalam-speaking southwestern region of Kerala and is almost entirely practiced and 
     appreciated by Malayali people.Kathakali is one of the eight classical dances of India
     Hanuman in Kathakali 
     Kathakali's roots are unclear. The fully developed style of Kathakali originated around the 17th century, but its roots are in the temple and folk arts (such as Krishnanattam and religious drama of the kingdom of the Zamorin of Calicut) southwestern Indian peninsula), which are traceable to at least the 1st millennium CE.[2][6] A Kathakali performance, like all classical dance arts of India, synthesizes music, vocal performers, choreography and hand and facial gestures together to express ideas. However, Kathakali differs in that it also incorporates movements from ancient Indian martial arts and athletic traditions of South India.) [2][3][5] Kathakali also differs in that the structure and details of its art form developed in the courts and theatres of Hindu principalities, unlike other
      classical Indian dances which primarily developed in Hindu temples and monastic schools.
