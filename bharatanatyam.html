      Bharatanatyam is a major form of Indian classical dance that originated in Tamil Nadu.
It is one of the eight widely recognized Indian classical dance forms, and expresses 
South Indian religious themes and spiritual ideas, particularly of Shaivism and in general 
of Hinduism.

A description of Bharatanatyam from the 2nd century CE can be found in the ancient
 Tamil epic Silappatikaram, while temple sculptures of the 6th to 9th century CE suggest
 it was a highly refined performance art by the mid-1st millennium CE.
Bharatanatyam is the oldest classical dance tradition in India.Bharatanatyam is the 
state dance form of Tamil Nadu.
